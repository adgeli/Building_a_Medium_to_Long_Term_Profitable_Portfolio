## Profitable Portfolio: Creating a Medium to Long Term Investment Strategy

This portfolio development project encompasses several Python skills obtained througout the Fintech Bootcamp course. Utilizing Python data visulizations tools such as; PyViz, Plotly Express, and HvPlot, partnered with Pandas data cleaning procedures, a financial analysis is conducted to identify opportunities of the well-defined investment algorithm.

### Project Objective 

Using an API, external sources of data, and a well defined algorithm, this project seeks to create a portfolio containing ten stocks generating the highest returns based on an algorithmic and S&P 500 historical trading data evaluation. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo simulation, optimal weight distribution analysis, and a risk analysis constisting of sharpe ratio and sortino ratio will provide an insightful financial analysis. 

### Research Direction 

Based on a simple moving average (SMA) crossover trading strategy, the 50 and 100 day windows for the SMA's will establish a profitable medium-to-long term portfolio. Additionally, a financial analysis will respond to the following queries;

1. Based on the algorithmic trading strategy applied to the S&P 500 stocks, what are the top ten companies returning the highest profit?

2. From the determined portfolio, what are the projected returns at the end of a 15 year period? Was the initial investment worth the financial outcome?

3. Compared to the S&P 500 index, what level of risk does the investor incur?

### Portfolio Performance 

The simple moving average trading algorithm is evaluated against the historical stock trading data from the 500 companies listed on the S&P 500. The results will generate a portfolio consisting of the ten stocks that have provided investors significant profit over the previous 3 year period. To determine the future success of the portfolio the following financial indicators are used;

1. 15 year Monte Carlo Simulation
2. Optimal Weight Distribution
3. Sharpe Ratio
4. Sortino Ratio
5. Efficiency Frontier
